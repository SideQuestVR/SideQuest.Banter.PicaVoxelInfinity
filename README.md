A trimmed-down continuation of [PicaVoxel](https://github.com/GarethIW/PicaVoxel) with support for infinite streamed voxel volumes. Think Minecraft terrain.

No docs as yet, but there's a demo scene included with a full setup for terrain with a runtime editor (manipulator) and disk-based persistence. There's also support for volume manipulation and voxel detection via Visual Scripting.

Can be installed as a Github Unity package: https://github.com/GarethIW/PicaVoxelInfinity.git?path=Packages/com.garethiw.picavoxelinfinity
